Save my [Delicious](https://del.icio.us) bookmarks. 

- `download.fsx`-script downloads all pages from your del.icio.us account. Next I'll extract all data (links, tags, captions) and export it in google.bookmarks.
- `content` folder contains all downloaded content. I save it here for reliability as https://del.icio.us is unstable.
